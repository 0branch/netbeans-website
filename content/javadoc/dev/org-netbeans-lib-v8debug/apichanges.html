<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>

<p>The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.</p>

<p>Fuller descriptions of all changes can be found below (follow links).</p>
<p>Not all deprecations are listed here, assuming that the deprecated
        APIs continue to essentially work. For a full deprecation list, please

        These API specification versions may be used to indicate that a module
        requires a certain API feature in order to function. For example, if you
        see here a feature you need which is labelled <samp>1.20</samp>, your
        manifest should contain in its main attributes the line:
      </p>
<pre>OpenIDE-Module-Module-Dependencies: org.netbeans.lib.v8debug &gt; 1.20</pre>
